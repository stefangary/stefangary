- 👋 Hi, I’m @stefangary.
- 👀 I’m interested in oceanography and scaling climate change solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about biological oceanography and databases and deepening my knowledge of Earth's climate system.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on physical oceanography (especially hydrography, e.g. [Hydrobase](https://github.com/stefangary/hydrobase3), and Lagrangian particle tracking) and developing scalabe workflows for apps that simulate earth system processes. 
- 📫 How to reach me: send an e-mail to my first name, middle initial, and last name at gmail (all together, no special characters).  My middle initial is F.
